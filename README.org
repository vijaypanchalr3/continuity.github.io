This website is built on hugo. Theming is all mine*. I took inspiration from many designs like Material, bootstrap. I took some codes (AS IT IS) from bootstrap's (exactly, nav on top). 

There is many problems in this site.

First and foremost is i want make submodules in theming, present theming is mixed with other things like posts and images. I want themes to separate folder and name it *continuity* as theme. Then work and commit it pretty differently then posts and images, i mean this whole pages.

Second problems is theme selection, presently i have only one light theme, i want it to be light/dark.

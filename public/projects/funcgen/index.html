  Function generator are useful tools in academia and industries. Mostly
they are avalaible in market. In this project we are trying to
understand and study simple frequency generators with use of OpAmp. We
usec generic OpAmp Ic LM741, which is single package and easy to
understand with benefit of extensive acedemic experince. 
</div></p>
<p>
Function generator is circuit which generates periodic function with
predictable frequencies with respect to time. Here, we will study only
mono frequency generator but it can also generate superposed functions.
Signals from Function generator comes in many forms but mostly it is
either sinusoidal or square wave. We will generate sinusoidal, square
and triangle wave as output.</p>
<p>
We used basic circuits with few modification as our need. With use of IC
LM741 we used OpAmp in our circuit.</p>
<p>
For Sinusoidal wave we used Wein Bridge circuit, which is easy to
understand and impliment. Also, wein bridge circuit is quite less noice
compare to it&#39;s compitition RC phase shift Oscillator, which have more
component than Wein bridge and more complicated to understand. For
Square wave we used standard astable multivibrator cicuit, with little
modification. Lastly, Triangle wave can be made from just attaching
Integrator to our square wave output with some regulation.</p>
<p>
Now, each circuit ( this wave form generator) has different block,
basically we divided whole circuit in there block. Main work for us is
to combine all of this. We wandered across CMOS families, BJTs but
finally we sattled into physical swith which is coupled for power
transmission and also for output change.[cite:@gayakwad2012op] [cite:@horowitz1989art] [cite:@wiki]</p>

<div id="outline-text-sec:org4d403e5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>As told in introduction each circuit is in their blocks. First block for
sine wave which is nothing but wien bridge circuit, second is sqaure
which is astable multivibrator, third for triangular wave which
integrator attached to second block (square wave block).</p>

Block 1: Sine wave generator
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-sec:org6e13760" class="outline-text-3">
<p>In first block, we have basic circuit of wein bridge. You can see in
figure 1. In center we have OpAmp (IC LM741). This is amplifier with RC
component attached with input and output. Here, at one end there is RC
parallel component and at other end series RC component.</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/sine.png" alt="../images/sine.png" title="../images/sine.png" /></p>
<p>
Here, frequency is given by,</p>
<p>
\[\label{eq:org513cb7c}
  f =\frac{1}{2 \pi RC}\]</p>
<p>
For sustaing oscilation gain must be 3 and for non inverting amplifier
gain,</p>
<p>
\[\label{eq:orgad3dd9a}
  A = 1+\frac{R_{F}}{R_{1}} = 3\]</p>
<p>
So, we get relation \(R_{F}=R_{1}\)</p>

Our block 1, which consinst of IC741CP

<p>
Here, you can see our block circuit, at the end we attached two zener
diode for regulation to the output. As you can see OpAmp in IC LM741
package. Power supply given from 4 and 7 to 12V and -12V. We chose
\(R_{1}=12k\Omega\). By relation of \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{F}\), we got
\(R_{F}=24k\Omega\).</p>
<p>
For frequency range we used Potential with max range of \(100k\Omega\).
So, lowest and maximum frequency whould be (with constant capacitance at
\(50nF\)),</p>
<p>
\[\label{eq:org284eb02}
  f_{min} = \frac{1}{2\pi\times100k\times 10n} \approx 159 hz\]</p>
<p>
\[\label{eq:orgc56dc93}
  f_{max} = \frac{1}{2\pi\times100\times 10n} \approx 159k hz\]</p>
<p>
So, frequency range would be \(159 hz\) to \(159k hz\)</p>

Tuning sine wave generator
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-sec:org696290c" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The output of sine wave generator can be little noisy. This will be
reasonable as we will see it&#39;s working. Any sine wave generator will
work as frequency extractor from DC or any AC levels. Since, Row signals
have superposed waves in nearly all the spectrum, one have to rely on
different filters and component which can attenuate desire frequency and
theoretically minimize every other frequency.</p>
<p>
In wien bridge, this is principle is mostly exploited. We have two RC
components, one in series make low pass filter and secondly there is
parallel component which work as high pass filter. In <strong><strong>figure</strong></strong> there
is highlighted areas of both filters. Here, it is quite straight forward
see that low pass will block higher frequency and high pass will vice
versa. So, if we set both filter such that combination will give us some
band (quite narrow band in fact). Center of this frequencies will cut
off frequency of both filters. When wien bridge balances than this band
of frequency will be resonated and give final output.</p>

Series RC components in Wien bridge
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-sec:org39fd4f2" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Series RC component which works as low pass filter have this type of
phenomenan, total \(V_{in}\) and \(V_{out}\) will be proportional to the
to total reactance. With voltage divider low,</p>

<p>
 <img src="../images/highpassfilter2.png" alt="../images/highpassfilter2.png" title="../images/highpassfilter2.png" /> </p>
<p>
\[\frac{V_o}{V_i}= \frac{X_c}{R+X_c}\]</p>
<p>
Where, \(X_c\) is reactance of capacitor valued as \(\frac{-j}{wC}\).
So,</p>
<p>
\[\frac{V_o}{V_i}=\left(\frac{1}{1+w^2R^2C^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\]</p>
<p>
If we take \(w_0\) as breakpoint or curoff point for our RC component
than \(w_0=\frac{1}{RC}\). Here RC is time constant.</p>
<p>
Graph of low pass shown in figure <a href="#fig:filters">3</a>a. Where we can see
frequency equals to \(w=w_0\) at some point. Also, notice that even
though we have cutoff frequency at \(w_0\), there is enough frequencies
around \(w_0\). Basically filters always have some noise which does not
filtered. Here, if you use higher order filter than this slope of
voltage to frequency would be slightly higher. With sufficiently high
order filter you can make abrupt change in frequency domain, but this
comes with it&#39;s consequences. With higher order filters other noises
dominates since we will have too much components. We will use second
order filter here, which is quite balance in accuracy and component
noise.</p>

Parallel RC components in Wien bridge
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-sec:org87adce6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Similarly to that of series RC components, we can define high pass
filter as parallel RC component. In parallel circuit when frequency
increases reactance decreases and total reactance decreases. So,
consequently higher frequency pass and lower frequency will not.
Reactance of high pass filter would be following,</p>

\[\frac{V_o}{V_i}= \frac{R}{R+X_c}\]</p>

Again, \(X_c\) is capacitance reactance and valued at \(-frac{-j}{wC}\)</p>
<p>
\[\frac{V_o}{V_i}=\left(\frac{R^2}{R^2+\frac{1}{w^2C^2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\]</p>

This relationship is shown in figure <a href="#fig:filters">3</a>b. With cutoff
frequency at \(w_0\). As we can see here also noise of unwanted
frequency range are here.</p>

Total signal and Error terms
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-sec:org9b4741e" class="outline-text-4">
<p>In wien bridge we have both the low pass and high pass filters. So,
total response of that shown in figure <a href="#fig:filters">3</a>c. Here, we
have gain frequencies in range between cutoff frequency. Since, this
range amplify in non inverting amplifier and feedback. This frequency
will resonant and becomes our output signal. From now on, we will say
\(w_0\) as resonant frequency. Final output in our theoretical studies
will be this resonant frequency. Practically this frequency is observed
with error frequencies.</p>
<p>
Error terms in here will be in following cases. /1) since we have band,
we get many frequency output from the band, which is quite distorted in
itself./ and <em>2) here working of filters are note up to expectation and
we have noise from whole spectrum of frequency.</em> This is quite headache,
unfortunately we have both the cases in our experiment.</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec:org54cc1eb" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec:org54cc1eb">
Fourier analysis of Output signal
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-sec:org54cc1eb" class="outline-text-4">
<p>We can minimize this errors by using Fourier analysis of output signal.
As one can say that DC level is made of superposed infinite number of
waves with different wavelengths,</p>
<p>
\[DC_{level}= \sum_{n}^{\infty}(a_n\cos(w_nt)+b_n\sin(w_nt))\]</p>
<p>
Here, \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) are coefficients of Fourier series. What wein
bridge does is extract desire frequency from DC level.</p>
<p>
In our experiment we got distorted sine wave which means their is higher
frequencies in effect. Also after some values of Potentiometer, there is
just square signal. Another distortion occur was from lower frequencies
manly \(\appro 50Hz\) and around \(300Hz\), which are making signal less
stable and sometimes dominates resonant frequency.</p>
<p>
For higher frequency, we got idea to put low pass filter around value of
resonant frequency that would bring signal to more on resonant
frequency. This is can be seen in block diagram of sine wave from figure
<a href="#fig:realsine">2</a> and figure below <a href="#fig:lowpass">4</a>. This should
give us better results ad we intended.</p>

For lower frequency, we have high pass filter, which eliminate those
lower frequencies and stabilize our signal. This can be shown from block
diagram figure <a href="#fig:realsine">2</a> and figure <a href="#fig:highpass">5</a>.</p>

Block 2: Square wave generator

<p>As square wave generator we have basic astable multivibrator. This
circuit works on scenario where output will have to stable state and it
will swing between them, hence the name.</p>

<p>
When circuit is \(+V_{sat}\), we will have high signal output and when
circuit is \(-V_{sat}\), we will have low signal output. So, we will
have square wave as desired. The circuit for astable multivibrator is
shown below.</p>
<p>
Here, frequency would be,</p>
<p>
\[\label{eq:org1a80d97}

\[\label{eq:orgfe0486d}

Here, we took \(R_{1} = 10k\Omega\) and \(R_{2} = 11.6k\Omega\) such

\(100k\Omega\) in input terminals for accurate and reliable signal.</p>

Frequency range would be of (for constant capacitance at \(47nF\)) and
here our \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are equal at \(10k\Omega\),</p>

Problems in getting Square wave
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-sec:orgf30ebeb" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Square wave is mostly (maybe lesser) immune to those porblem of sine
wave generator but still it has serious problem. Mainly of slew rate
problem, which is quite fundamental to OpAmp than particular circuit.
For understanding this phenomena we should exploit inner working of
OpAmp.</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s define some phenomena before taking serious talk on output
signals.</p>
<p>
<strong><strong>1) Transient state:</strong></strong> After some initial stable state, if the system
(for us the OpAmp) comes at another steady state, the intermediate state
is called transient state.</p>
<p>
<strong><strong>2) Steady state:</strong></strong> The state at which system has fix value of response
(stable) which independent on time is called steady state (response).</p>
<p>
<strong><strong>3) Slew rate:</strong></strong> State is maximum rate of change with respect to
microsecond of time.</p>
<p>
\[S = \left.\frac{dV}{dt}\right|_{max}\]</p>
<p>
It is measured in \(\frac{V}{\mu s}\). After seeing this, it&#39;s quite
transparent to see the problem in our square wave generator. Also, the
thing is slew rate is slop of signal with voltage and time domain. We
can also see that it&#39;ll show us how gradual signal change from two
steady state.</p>
<p>
When signal is at \(\pm V_{sat}\), it is at steady state. When it&#39;s
changes signal goes into transient state. A fact that Slew rate is
fundamental property IC (LM741 has slew rate around
\(\appro .5 V/\mu s\)), which shows us how some IC is more reactive and
some are not. This also defines Bandwidth some times. If we take high
frequency which change so rapidly that slew rate can&#39;t keep up to signal
than signal will not even change after some frequency value.</p>

Output of square wave
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-sec:orge9f83c7" class="outline-text-4">
<p>In out project we have IC LM741 with slewrate of \(0.5 V/\mu s\). Which
directly means that our square wave will not look square wave after some
frequencies value. For example look at this results after some
\(10k Hz\) it is deforming.</p>
<p>
For better result, we can use OpAmp with higher slew rate. Typically
<em>current feedback OpAmp</em> has higher response type, consequently higher
slew rate (in the order of \(4k V/\mu s\)). Even for some voltage
feedback OpAmp has higher Slew rate in range of \(500 V/\mu s\) to
\(3000 V/\mu s\). Some ICs and it&#39;s slew rate value are shown in this
table.</p>

<p>A Basic integrator is shown in figure <a href="#fig:triang">7</a>. Which can
modified as out need. Here basic passive components like capacitor and
resistor used with OpAmp. The basic Integrator is made of inverting
amplifier configuration. It has capacitor as feedback component. We used
resistor of \(100k\Omega\) in parallel to capacitor to stabilize
integration operation. Since, capacitor as very low reactance at
feedback. Here, inverting mode is employed so we have inverting input as
virtual ground. Here, changing rate is determined by RC time constant.
OpAmp produces ramp output till capacitor gets fully charged. The
capacitor charges current decreases by the influence between the virtual
ground and negative output.</p>

<p>For connection of all this block we have used DPST switch with. This
have two poles, one for power controlling and other for output

When switch is <strong><strong>ON</strong></strong> it will connect 1 terminals with common and
complete the circuit. When switch is <strong><strong>OFF</strong></strong> (pulled condition), the
circuit will open and we will not get connection.</p>

The +Vcc in common (upper common) is completely independent of Output

Ceramic resistor

<div id="outline-text-sec:org9b7a59f" class="outline-text-4">
<p>A ceramic resistor is a fixed resistor used in electronic circuits. As
name suggests the resistor&#39;s name suggest it is made from ceramic as
substrate. Ceramic resistors are compact and versatile. Ceramic
resistors are made by mixing ceramic powder with metallic oxide powder
to form a paste. The paste is then shaped into a cylinder or rectangle
and dried before being fired in a kiln. The firing process produces a
dense, hard, and non-porous ceramic substrate that is stable at high
temperatures and resistant to thermal shock.</p>
<p>
<em>Advantages of ceramic resistors:</em> a) high power rating. That means they
can be used in higher power use case scenario compare to other type of
resistors.\\</p>
<ol>
<li>As i said, ceramic resistor are compact and versatile.\\</li>
<li>very reliable and low with tolerances. They get lower drift over time</li>

Ceramics capacitor

<div id="outline-text-sec:orgd32a6a6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>As name suggest it is made of ceramic as its dielectric material. There
are most common in making electronic circuits. Ceramic capacitors are
made by applying a layer of ceramic material to a metal electrode,
creating a sandwich-like structure. The electrodes are then connected to
leads or terminals, forming the capacitor. The thickness of the ceramic
layer determines the capacitor&#39;s capacitance value, with thinner layers
resulting in lower capacitance values and thicker layers resulting in
higher capacitance values.</p>
<p>
<em>Advantages of ceramic capacitor</em>: a) ceramic capacitors can have high
dielectric constant since ceramic have ceramic very low conductivity.
This means it can store more energy in smaller package.\\</p>
<ol>
<li>they are small and lightweight. This is quite needed in modern</li>

Polypropylene capacitor

<p>Polyester film capacitors are film capacitors using a dielectric made of
the thermoplastic polar polymer material polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), trade names Hostaphan or Mylar, from the polyester family. They
are manufactured both as metallized wound and stacked versions, as well
as film/foil types. The dielectric films, depending on the desired
dielectric strength, are drawn in a special process to an extremely thin
thickness, and are then provided with electrodes. The electrodes of film
capacitors may be metallized aluminum or zinc applied directly to the
surface of the plastic film, or a separate metallic foil. Film
capacitors, together with ceramic capacitors and electrolytic
capacitors, are the most common capacitor types for use in electronic
equipment, and are used in many AC and DC microelectronics and
electronics circuits</p>

zener diode
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-sec:orge75e11e" class="outline-text-4">
<p>A zener diode is a type of diode that is designed to operate in the
reverse breakdown region of its voltage-current characteristics. This
makes it useful as a voltage regulator in electronic circuits. The
voltage across a zener diode is determined by the breakdown voltage,
which is the voltage at which the diode starts to conduct in the reverse
direction. Once the breakdown voltage is reached, the zener diode will
conduct and maintain a relatively constant voltage across its terminals,
regardless of changes in the applied voltage. This is main work of zener
diode. It&#39;s straight voltage regulators with Fixed maximum voltage.</p>
<p>
Here, we have 12 volt zener diode, which is adequate for our purpose and
regulating small voltage variations.</p>
<p>
If we take \(V_z\) as voltage across the zener diode, \(I_z\) as current
through the diode, and R is the resistance of the load connected to the
diode. In a typical voltage regulator circuit, the load resistance is
known and fixed, so the voltage across the zener diode is determined by
the current flowing through the diode. Current in reverse breakdown
state,</p>
<p>
\[I_z = \frac{V_z - V_r}{R}\]</p>
<p>
where, \(V_r\) is the reverse voltage applied to the diode.</p>
<p>
It can also be used as voltage clamper and voltage reference
applications.</p>
